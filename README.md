Building a Custom Knowledge Base Chatbot with Bedrock
What Inspired Me
I was inspired by the growing need within organizations to automate internal knowledge access. Employees often waste time searching through countless documents, manuals, and wikis. I wanted to build a system that could instantly retrieve accurate answers to internal queries using natural language, combining the capabilities of Amazon Bedrock with a serverless data architecture to ensure scalability and reliability.
What I Learned
This project deepened my understanding of:
	Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases: How Bedrock orchestrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), combining large language models (LLMs) with enterprise data sources.
	Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless: Its elasticity and ability to manage structured and semi-structured data without managing server instances manually.
	Vector embeddings: Storing semantic representations of text and enabling high-quality similarity searches.
	Latency optimization and query efficiency using indexed embeddings.
I also learned to use retrieval scoring metrics such as cosine similarity, where similarity is computed with:
"similarity"(A,B)=(A⋅B)/(‖A‖‖B‖)
This formula allowed me to assess how close two embedding vectors were, ensuring accurate document matching for retrieval.
How I Built It
	Data Ingestion
I connected Amazon Bedrock’s knowledge base feature to our company’s documentation stored in Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless.
Structured and unstructured data were embedded using Amazon Titan Embeddings.
	Knowledge Base Configuration
I defined vector storage parameters and linked the database through AWS SDKs. Bedrock automatically synchronized new documents and updates from Aurora.
	Chat Interface Development
I built a simple web interface using React and AWS Amplify, enabling real-time queries. Each question was sent to Bedrock’s RAG pipeline, which retrieved relevant context before the language model generated answers.
	Testing and Evaluation
I benchmarked response accuracy and latency, scripting comparison tests between standalone LLM responses and RAG-enhanced answers.
Challenges I Faced
	Vector Indexing Complexity: Efficient similarity searches in PostgreSQL required precise tuning of indexing and partitioning.
	Schema Evolution: Handling document schema updates without breaking retrieval mappings was tricky.
	Cost Optimization: Balancing real-time query performance with serverless scaling costs demanded multiple iterations.
	Access Control: Integrating fine-grained access permissions to ensure private data stayed secure for authorized users.
Despite these challenges, the chatbot ultimately demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency, providing employees with a powerful conversational interface to their internal data.
